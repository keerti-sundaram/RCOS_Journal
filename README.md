# RCOS_Journal
Keeping track of my contributions for RCOS

This includes (so far):

- Learning process of Wagtail and Django
- Learning process of Wagtail Forms
- Attempt to correct bug in Forms implementation (added get submission and get process functions, imported from django.conf import settings and from wagtail.contrib.forms.models import AbstractFormSubmission)
