After downloading and setting up pipeline (used readme from https://github.com/thepoly/pipeline/blob/master/README.md), set up admin access to Wagtail site (using local host site and added \admin to the end, then logged in).

Practicing using current Poly articles, the goal is to become familiar with Wagtail sites.

1. Have article information (i.e. author, title, body)
2. Create a child page
3. Choose type of page to create (I primarily used "Article page" as I was using current articles on the site)
4. Fill in article information, make sure to add a Slug, under promote bar
5. Preview to view how the article would look
6. Save
